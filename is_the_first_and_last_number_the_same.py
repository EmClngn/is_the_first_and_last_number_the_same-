# Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return False.

# pseudo code

# ask user for number of elements they want in the list
desired_number_of_list = input("How many numbers of elements do you want in the list? ")
print(desired_number_of_list)

# make user input said elements
# write the program to identify whether or not the first and last number of the list is the same
