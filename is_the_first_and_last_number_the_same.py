# Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return False.

# pseudo code

# ask user for number of elements they want in the list
desired_number_of_list = int(input("How many numbers of elements do you want in the list? "))
list = []

# make user input said elements
for i in range(desired_number_of_list):
    elements = input("Input your element: ")
    list.append(elements)
print(list)
# write the program to identify whether or not the first and last number of the list is the same
